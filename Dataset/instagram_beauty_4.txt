It’s hella rare that I use a whole line of skincare for the first time and errythang is a success...I was rubbing my face all deng day after I did this routine (I could subconsciously hear my mom tellin me to get my dirty hands off my face 😆) Hennyways..everything is from @glowrecipe and not only did they all smell good af but my face felt soft af afterward...and after a busy non stop week it was just the boost my skin needed! 🙌🏾
