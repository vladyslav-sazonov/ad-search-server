I’ve been taking extra care to prioritize my skin’s needs below the neck🧖🏾‍♀️And these 5️⃣items are in super heavy rotation. They say “summer bodies” are made in the winter👙 — so game on! 💆🏽‍♀️ @p.g.prime CBD infused Hydrating Body Balm is incredible for achy body parts and relieving tension. This is my second bottle. I’ve gifted it to two friends, and both couldn’t believe the immediate result. Soreness gone and majorly relaxed. Not a medical claim...basically just hearsay from me and my frens...[🙋🏽‍♀️but you can’t trust us] 🇬🇭 @randrluxury Shea Oil is made in Ghana, and my God — the formula is glorious🙏🏾. I’ve been using it since the summer and my body stays un-ashy all day long. I see that the brand gifted @iamcardib with product while she was in Ghana 🗣Cardi, if you’re listening: “I know you’re gifted lots of things, but don’t sleep on this” [or send it to me if you don’t want it #ijs] ‼️ Stop everything and order @urbanskinrx Glow From Head Toe Toe Body Collection✨You are not going to catch my dimpley thighs slipping this summer💁🏽‍♀️A few days a week (at night) I apply the Eventone Body Smoothing Treatment. Formulated with 12% glycolic acid, 2 kojic acid and retinol (trifecta for smooth texture)— this body treatment is about that LIFE. Smoother lower body skin is loading. And the Clear Skin Clarifying back and body spray is perfect to start using now. Don’t you hate when you wanna pop out in a halter top and be like: 😢”Where all these back pimples and blemishes come from?!! Yup! No. We don’t need that problem. 🙈And did I mention I have cellulite? Because I do. True story. But between the @urbanskinrx products above and this @cheekyphysique cellulite smoothing cupping massage system, my thighs are coming along quite nicely, thank you very much☺️ 🥳Now it’s your turn.
