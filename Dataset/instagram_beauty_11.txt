It’s finally here!! You may have already seen this mug in @Sephora stores, but I’m so excited to reveal my first collab with @bobbibrown! 🤩 Allow me to introduce my very own Crushed Liquid Lip, Double Crush Edition. Why double crush? This was actually the best part of this collab: I got to do it with my bestie @makeupbydenise! When they asked us to do this collab we knew it was the perfect project to do together. We decided our colors would be complementary: Two nude shades that would work for a variety of complexions, that you can actually mix together for a custom nude shade, too. I created West Coast Bae, a warm milk chocolate-y nude, and Denise created East Coast Slay, a lighter warm nude with a touch of peach. We wanted our friendship to be represented in the names of the shades, since I’m on the west coast and she’s on the east coast! 👯‍♀️ I can’t wait for you guys to try! Thank you so much for all the support leading up to this launch, you all made us more excited than anything else!!! And if you’re going to be in LA on May 18th, Denise and I will be hosting a meet up at the Sephora in Century City at 4pm, so come hang out with us!!
