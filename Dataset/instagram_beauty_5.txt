I now have another @yslbeauty fragrance to add to my collection. It’s called Libre (which means free in French) and has the perfect balance of floral with a touch of musk. I love the meaning behind its name because to feel free is one of the best feelings ever. I love the fact that I have built my career on being 100% myself and not letting success change who I am. It’s freeing to know that I can be “me” at all times and still receive so much love from you all, thank you 😘❤️ #yslbeautycrew
PS...this has to be one of the prettiest perfume bottles I’ve seen! (swipe left) 😍
