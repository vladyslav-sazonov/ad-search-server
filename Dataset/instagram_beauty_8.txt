The power of a matching foundation... you already know I love my @PURcosmetics Love Your Selfie 4-in-1 foundation - I reviewed it on my channel about a month ago. YES, there are 100 shades so everyone can find a match, but let’s not forget that coverage and finish, which is exactly why I keep reaching for it! This is one of a few foundations that doesn’t emphasize my pores and works for my super oily skin. My natural shade is MG5 (medium with a golden undertone).
