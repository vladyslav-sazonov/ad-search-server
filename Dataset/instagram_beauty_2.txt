I've relied on @batiste_us dry shampoo to help me get the most out of my day for YEADS! I have very dry hair so I have to be careful that I don't wash it too often or over-shampoo so it helps keep my hair fresh between washes and gives me so much volume while styling! Lately I've really been loving Batiste Dry Shampoo Plus for dark hair... it helps hide my grays when I can't be bothered to dye them. Getting a break from my high maintenance hair gives me more time to tackle my to-do list or just squeeze in more QT with my daughter!
